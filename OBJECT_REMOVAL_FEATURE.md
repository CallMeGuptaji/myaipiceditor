# AI Object Removal Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Modern AI-powered object removal using the lama.onnx model with an intuitive brush-based interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ObjectRemovalScreen.kt
- **Interactive Canvas**: Paint over objects with adjustable brush
- **Zoom & Pan**: Two-finger gestures for precise selection
- **Live Preview**: Semi-transparent red overlay shows masked areas
- **Modern UI**: Material Design 3 with smooth animations

### 2. Brush System
- **Adjustable Size**: 10-100px brush size slider
- **Draw/Erase Modes**: Toggle between adding and removing mask areas
- **Undo/Redo**: 50-step history for stroke management
- **Reset**: Clear all strokes and start over

### 3. AI Processing (ObjectRemoval.kt)
- **Preprocessing**: Resizes to 512x512, normalizes with ImageNet stats
- **Inference**: ONNX Runtime with GPU acceleration (NNAPI)
- **Postprocessing**: Converts output back to original resolution
- **Smart Blending**: Seamlessly merges inpainted areas with original

### 4. User Flow
1. Tap "AI Object Removal" button
2. Paint over unwanted objects (red overlay appears)
3. Adjust brush size as needed
4. Use eraser mode to refine selection
5. Tap "Apply AI" to process
6. AI removes objects and fills background naturally

### 5. Technical Details
- Model: lama.onnx (512x512 input)
- Async processing keeps UI responsive
- Mask creation from vector strokes
- Feathered edges for natural results
- Multiple passes supported

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `BrushStroke.kt` - Data models for brush strokes and state
- ✅ `ObjectRemovalScreen.kt` - Full UI implementation
- ✅ `ObjectRemoval.kt` - AI inference and image processing
- ✅ `EditorState.kt` - State management updates
- ✅ `EditorViewModel.kt` - Business logic and actions
- ✅ `MainActivity.kt` - Screen integration
- ✅ `FeatureButtons.kt` - Updated action reference
- ✅ `FaceRestoration.kt` - Signature update
- ✅ `ImageUpscaler.kt` - Signature update

## Usage Example
```kotlin
// User taps AI Object Removal
viewModel.handleAction(EditorAction.StartObjectRemoval)

// User draws strokes
viewModel.handleAction(EditorAction.AddRemovalStroke(stroke))

// User applies AI processing
viewModel.handleAction(EditorAction.ApplyObjectRemoval)
```

## Performance
- GPU acceleration via NNAPI when available
- Async processing with loading indicators
- Optimized bitmap operations
- Memory-efficient stroke history

## Next Steps (Optional)
- [ ] Auto-detect objects with ML
- [ ] Smart brush following object edges
- [ ] Save/load mask presets
- [ ] Batch object removal
